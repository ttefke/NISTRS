/// Runs Test.
/// The focus of this test is the total number of runs in the sequence, where a run is an uninterrupted sequence
/// of identical bits. A run of length k consists of exactly k identical bits and is bounded before and after with
/// a bit of the opposite value. The purpose of the runs test is to determine whether the number of runs of
/// ones and zeros of various lengths is as expected for a random sequence. In particular, this test determines
/// whether the oscillation between such zeros and ones is too fast or too slow.
/// # Example
/// ```
/// use nistrs::runs::runs_test;
/// use nistrs::BitsData;
///
/// let data = BitsData::from_text("11001001000011111101101010100010001000010110100011000010001101001100010011000110011000101000101110000000".to_string());
