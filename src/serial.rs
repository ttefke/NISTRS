/// sequence. The purpose of this test is to determine whether the number of occurrences of the 2m m-bit
/// overlapping patterns is approximately the same as would be expected for a random sequence. Random
/// sequences have uniformity; that is, every m-bit pattern has the same chance of appearing as every other
/// m-bit pattern. Note that for m = 1, the Serial test is equivalent to the Frequency test.
