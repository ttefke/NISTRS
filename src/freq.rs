/// Frequency (Monobit) Test.
///
/// The focus of the test is the proportion of zeroes and ones for the entire sequence. The purpose of this test
/// is to determine whether the number of ones and zeros in a sequence are approximately the same as would
/// be expected for a truly random sequence. The test assesses the closeness of the fraction of ones to 1/2, that
/// is, the number of ones and zeroes in a sequence should be about the same. All subsequent tests depend on
/// the passing of this test.
/// # Example
/// ```
/// use nistrs::freq::frequency_test;
/// use nistrs::BitsData;

/// let data = BitsData::from_text("11001001000011111101101010100010001000010110100011000010001101001100010011000110011000101000101110001100".to_string());
